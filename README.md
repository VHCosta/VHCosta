    Thank you Gabi, for letting me steal your hard work

My name is VÃ­tor Costa and I'm a full stack developer in the Azores, Portugal. 

I am a graduate from Academia de CÃ³digo's full-stack programming bootcamp. I have worked in web development and love to learn new technologies.

I love to learn new tech like I enjoy learning a song: diving head-on into the storm, picking it apart and learning know how it works, because it's through that struggle that I have the most fun.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on revitalizing my repos and creating my professional portfolio. Expect higher quality code and descriptions.\
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning better time management skills.\
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on making a game with talented developers interested in RPG's.
