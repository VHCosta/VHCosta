My name is VÃ­tor Costa and I'm a full stack developer in Ilha Terceira, Portugal. 

I just graduated from <Academia de CÃ³digo_>'s intensive 14-week full-stack programming bootcamp, and I'm currently looking for my first job in the area.

I love to learn new technologies like I enjoy learning a song: hitting the ground running, diving head-on into the storm, picking it apart to know how it works, because it's through that struggle that one truly grows.
